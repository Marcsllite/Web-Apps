          This page contains links to all the p5.js coding challenges
          I am working on. The challenges are from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/">The Coding Train</a>
          YouTube channel's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH">coding challenges</a> playlist.
          I have added my spin to each challenge on top of going along with the flow of the videos.

            <strong>Description: </strong><br>In this coding challenge
            I created a snake game. The snake and food start out in a random location on the board
            and the snake is white and the food is red. The goal of the game is to eat enough food where 
            the snake fills the entire board. The player will fail if the snake's head touches its body 
            or the snake tries to leave the screen. Upon losing an image will pop up and the user can click 
            that image to play again. There is no score mechanic, but I might add that in at a later time.

            <strong>Description: </strong><br>In this coding challenge I followed
            Dan Shiffman's video to the letter. This challenge is far from over and 
            I want to change up the functionality and make it playable on mobile devices as well. 
            For now it is a flower watering game where there are a static number of flowers and 
            the user can only move along the bottom of the screen using the left and right keys. 
            The movement isn't fluid and the flowers grow when watered (space key is pressed). First 
            thing I would like to do is flip the orientation. Flowers on the bottom with stems growing from 
            the ground. the user is a watering can at the top that can drop water on each flower. Each 
            flower has a water limit where they will be over watered and their petals will fall out and 
            a seed will fall back into the ground and after a certain time another flower will grow. There will 
            be a score to keep track of how many flowers the user has over watered. If the flowers grow too big 
            the user loses and can start over again. I will try and implement this at a later time but for now 
            this challenge is incomplete

            <strong>Description: </strong><br>This coding challenge starts off with a huge circle in the middle 
            of the screen. When the user clicks on the circle it will divide into two smaller circles and the 
            user can click one of those two smaller circles and they will divide and so on. At the bottom right 
            of the screen is the number of lives the user has. if the user clicks on the screen and there is no 
            circle present where they clicked the user loses a life. If the user clicks on the screen where there 
            is a circle present the user gains a life. the lives text will turn green when the user gains a life and 
            red if they lose one. When the circles reach a certain size they will resize back up to a properly clickable size.
            All of the circles on the screen will be moving and bouncing off the edges so it is not as easy to click them.
