          This page contains links to all the p5.js coding challenges
          I am working on. The challenges are from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/">The Coding Train</a>
          YouTube channel's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH">coding challenges</a> playlist.
          I have added my spin to each challenge on top of going along with the flow of the videos.

            <strong>Description: </strong><br>In this coding challenge
            I created a snake game. The snake and food start out in a random location on the board
            and the snake is white and the food is red. The goal of the game is to eat enough food where 
            the snake fills the entire board. The player will fail if the snake's head touches its body 
            or the snake tries to leave the screen. Upon losing an image will pop up and the user can click 
            that image to play again. There is no score mechanic, but I might add that in at a later time.

            <strong>Description: </strong><br>This is a modified version of space invaders. Instead of space aliens
            invading, there are flowers that start at the bottom of the screen and grow upwards. The player is a watering
            can at the top of the screen sending drops of water to wither the flowers before they reach the top.
            This game is not finished yet and currently only has the flowers swaying at the bottom of the screen,
            drops that go from the top of the screen to where you clicked, the flowers can lose their petals
            until they have withered away, and the flowers grow every 3 seconds until they reach the top. I still need 
            to add the watering can at top of the screen, add the score, start, and game over screens. Currently the game
            stops if a flower reaches the top or if the player withered all the flowers away.

            <strong>Description: </strong><br>This coding challenge starts off with a huge circle in the middle 
            of the screen. When the user clicks on the circle it will divide into two smaller circles and the 
            user can click one of those two smaller circles and they will divide and so on. At the bottom right 
            of the screen is the number of lives the user has. if the user clicks on the screen and there is no 
            circle present where they clicked the user loses a life. If the user clicks on the screen where there 
            is a circle present the user gains a life. the lives text will turn green when the user gains a life and 
            red if they lose one. When the circles reach a certain size they will resize back up to a properly clickable size.
            All of the circles on the screen will be moving and bouncing off the edges so it is not as easy to click them.
